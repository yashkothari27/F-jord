      <strong>Welcome to Fjord</strong>
      <div class="my-4"></div>
      <strong>Redefining How the World Invests in Real Assets</strong><div class="my-2"></div>
      For decades, investing in real estate and other premium assets was a privilege reserved for the wealthy few, characterised by high entry barriers and limited access.
      <div class="my-4"></div>
      At Fjord, we believe it’s time to change that.
      <div class="my-4"></div>
      We are a pioneering platform dedicated to the tokenisation of Real World Assets (RWA) — using our own Layer 1 Blockchain to empower anyone to invest in tangible, secure assets such as real estate, land, and precious metals.
      <div class="my-4"></div>
      Today, Fjord offers investors access to a growing marketplace of 50+ premium real estate listings, with more added every month.
      Through our platform, anyone can participate in fractional ownership, diversify their portfolio, and benefit from the long-term value of real assets.

    </div>`,
    introduction: `<div>
       Blockchain is no longer an emerging trend — it’s becoming the foundation for tomorrow’s industries.
      <div class="my-4"></div>
      One of the sectors where it’s already driving massive change is real estate.
      <div class="my-4"></div>
      For decades, property investing was limited to the wealthy few, with complex legal processes, high capital requirements, and illiquid markets.
      <div class="my-4"></div>
      However, tokenisation, powered by blockchain, is now opening the door to a more transparent, efficient, and accessible real estate landscape.
      <div class="my-4"></div>
      At Fjord, we are building this future today — leveraging our own Layer 1 Blockchain to power secure, transparent, and fully compliant tokenisation of Real World Assets (RWA) like real estate.

          Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger that records transactions securely across a network of computers.
          <div class="my-2"></div>
          Every transaction is stored in a block, linked in chronological order, forming an unchangeable chain of records.

          <strong>Key benefits:</strong>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Decentralisation: No central authority controls the data.</li>
            <li>Transparency: All transactions are visible to network participants.</li>

       <div class="my-1"></div>
       Even big players need a safe ship to sail through the rough seas of high market volatility, especially in times of war, political crisis, and uncertainty. This is where Real World Assets (RWA) come in.

       Real World Assets are physical or tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and infrastructure that are integrated into the digital economy through tokenization. 
       <div class="my-1"></div> 
       By representing these assets on the blockchain, RWAs bridge traditional finance and decentralized systems, offering greater accessibility, liquidity, and efficiency. This innovation enables fractional ownership, transparent transactions, and global market participation, revolutionizing how we invest and interact with physical assets.
        <div class="my-1"></div>
        These assets provide stability and diversification during market volatility (as happens in crypto) by anchoring value to tangible assets like real estate. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which can experience extreme price swings, RWAs maintain intrinsic value tied to real-world markets. Adding blockchain technology to the equation reduces overall portfolio risk, enhances investor confidence, and fosters long-term sustainability.

                <li>
                Liquidity increases dramatically through secondary markets. By breaking down assets into smaller, tradable tokens, tokenization unlocks liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate or fine art.
                </li>
                <li>
                Investors can own a fraction of high-value assets, making them more accessible to a broader audience. This also makes for a simpler investment, requiring less money to jump in.

                Blockchain technology facilitates cross-border transactions, opening markets to global investors without intermediaries. These RWA are now globally accessible to everyone.

Holders can propose, vote on, and implement changes related to project upgrades, funding allocations, and other key decisions. These tokens empower communities to manage decentralized platforms collectively, fostering transparency and inclusivity. Governance tokens are often earned through participation, staking, or as rewards, aligning users’ incentives with the project's long-term success.

                </div>
                <div>While their regulated nature sometimes requires centralized oversight, security tokens still play a key role in decentralization. For instance, they enable fractional ownership of high-value assets such as prime real estate, making such investments accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, they can facilitate cross-border investments using blockchain technology, keeping out intermediaries and barriers to entry for global investors, including brokers and traditional financial institutions.
                <div class="my-1"></div>
                The smart contracts that usually power security tokens can help reduce the need for manual processes such as verifying investor accreditation or processing returns. This in turn makes it easier to streamline operations and reduce costs.
                <div class="my-1"></div>
                Depending on the project, such tokens can also offer governance rights, allowing their holders to vote on key decisions regarding the project o, thus aligning with decetralized principles by empowering a distributed group of stakeholders.

       Utility tokens are designed to give access to specific products or services within a blockchain or decentralized application. While they may not be tied to real world assets like security tokens, they can facilitate the infrastructure and operations that make platforms tokenizing or managing RWAs viable. 
       <div class="my-1"></div> 
       Such tokens can act as the currency or key for interacting within platforms tokenizing real estate art, or commodities such as gold. For example users may be required to hold a utility token in order to list assets, pay transaction fees, or participate in the exchange of tokenized assets.
        <div class="my-1"></div>
        RWA platforms may also use utility tokens as a medium for service payments, including certification, storage of asset data, or transaction processing fees.
        <div class="my-1"></div>
        Furthermore, they can be used to reward users of an RWA platform, including validators and service providers. For example, a property tokenization platform could reward participants for verifying asset data or providing liquidity for trading tokenized real estate.

In that scenario, how can you confirm a statement is legitimate when processing tens of thousands of requests every second? Would you trust a single individual to validate every request? Or do you need a system fostering fairness? 
        <div class="my-4"></div>
        The answer to all those pressing questions lies in one simple system— a blockchain protocol, otherwise known as a consensus mechanism. 
        <div class="my-4"></div>
        So, what exactly is a blockchain protocol?
        <div class="my-4"></div>
        At its core, blockchain protocols are systems designed with a collective yet transparent approach. Many participants contribute to validating transactions within a blockchain. To put it into perspective, think of blockchain protocol as a digital jury where every participant has a vote, ensuring no single individual has extreme power. 
        <div class="my-4"></div>
        Moreover, blockchain protocols marry transparency, trust, and fairness to ensure networks remain secure and decentralized.
        <div class="my-4"></div>

        heading: "Proof of Authority (PoA)",
        para: `<div>
              Coined in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Proof of Authority is a protocol that relies on blockchain identity to validate transactions and create blocks. Interestingly, it shares similarities with Proof of Stake in that trusted validators secure the network. 
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              
              The nucleus of the Proof of Authority protocol is reputation. Every node must earn the chance to validate transactions by building a good reputation. Thus, day in and day out, the nodes strive to develop a good reputation to earn the right to validate. 
              
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              For clarity, reputable nodes possess the following requirements: 

              <ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
                <li>
                Trustworthy validator with a good moral standing and no criminal record.
                </li>
                <li>
                The network must validate the face behind the node.
                </li>
                <li>
                Validators must be ready for serious scrutiny.
                </li>
              </ul>

               <div class="my-1"></div>
               As a result, validators undergo intense scrutiny to ensure only the reliable ones are chosen. However, once a validator is approved, the processes become autonomous. This means there is hardly any need to monitor the nodes constantly. 
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              Moreover, while multiple nodes are selected, only one validates transactions, releasing a new block. Subsequently, every other validator confirms the block's validity before it's added to the chain. Once the block is added, the leadership role rotates to the next selected node.
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              Should a validator process fraudulent transactions, their reputation is ruined, potentially leading to a loss of their investment. Indeed, that's a steep price to pay for dishonesty. 
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              Fast-forward to 2024, and several RWA projects, including Vechain, use the POA protocol. Meanwhile, Venus, another RWA project, employs a hybrid of PoS and PoA known as Proof of Staked Authority, which follows the rules of PoA.
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              Some of the reasons PoA is gaining popularity within the RWA space include high scalability, energy efficiency, fast block times, cost-effectiveness, and real-world accountability. The disadvantages include centralization risks, validator trust, and limited use cases.

              Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) is an innovative approach that combines the strengths of Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority to enhance the scalability, security, and efficiency of the blockchain in question.
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              
              From conception, PoSA aimed to address some limitations associated with traditional consensus mechanisms and soon became a popular choice for blockchains, including <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/90 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://iotex.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IoTeX</a>.

It employs PoSA to ensure scalability and reliability for connected devices.
              
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              In this mechanism, Authority and Staking are combined to provide peak performance. Foremost, building on the philosophy of PoA, validators must be pre-approved based on reputation. Secondly, by buying from the PoS ideas, validators must lock in a significant amount of cryptocurrency to participate, creating an economic incentive to act honestly.
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              
              This hybrid mechanism follows the following short process:

              <ul class="pl-5 list-disc">
                <li>
                Block Validation: Validators are selected to create and validate blocks based on their staked assets and authority.
                </li>
                <li>
                Incentives: Validators earn rewards in the form of transaction fees or block rewards.
                </li>
                <li>
                Accountability: If a validator behaves maliciously or negligently, they risk losing their staked assets and reputation.
                </li>
              </ul>

               <div class="my-1"></div>
               Owing to the hybrid design, the blockchain enjoys the scalability brought by PoA with the financial incentives of PoS. All this is done while providing the utmost energy efficiency compared to PoW.

But how does it work?  
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              
              Similar to PoW, Proof of Spacetime demands nodes prove that they have enough storage space to store network data. Unlike PoW, which focuses on computational power, Proof of Spacetime focuses on storage capacity and duration.
              
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              The process begins with network participants dedicating some storage capacity to encrypted network data. Following this, participants provide periodic cryptographic proofs of their commitment. 
              <div class="my-1"></div>

              The network verifies the proof, allowing participants to earn rewards.
              <div class="my-1"></div>

              Beyond merely ensuring data integrity, the storage commitments contribute to the network's consensus mechanism. More precisely, they help determine who gets to add the next block to the blockchain.

              <div class="my-1"></div>
              
              For instance, Proof of Authority highlights the relevance of reputation within the blockchain space. As projects like Vechain, Centrifuge, and Chromia demonstrate, no one-size-fits-all approach exists.
              
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              For all blockchain projects entering the RWA space, choosing a good consensus mechanism can be likened to laying a robust foundation for a skyscraper. Yet, as blockchain tech and trends continue to evolve, we are likely to see more evolutions in consensus protocols.

              <div>Unlike the energy-guzzling Proof of Work (PoW), where miners battle over cryptographic puzzles like caffeinated gladiators, or the money-centric Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Authority relies on trustworthiness. Think of it as the VIP guest list for blockchain validators where only the most reputable, verified entities get in.

             The concept of green real estate proposes the design, construction, and operation of buildings and spaces that prioritize environmental sustainability, energy efficiency, and the well-being of occupants. This model integrates eco-friendly materials, renewable energy sources, and innovative technologies to create structures that reduce environmental impact while enhancing functionality and comfort.

                </div>
              <div>The importance of green real estate cannot be overstated. First, it addresses one of the most pressing global challenges, which is climate change. Buildings are responsible for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making the adoption of sustainable practices essential to reducing this significant contributor. Green real estate helps mitigate this impact by decreasing energy consumption and promoting renewable energy use.
              
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              Second, it supports economic resilience. Though green buildings may have higher upfront costs, they lead to substantial long-term savings through lower energy bills, reduced maintenance costs, and higher property value. Additionally, governments and organizations worldwide are offering incentives for sustainable construction, further enhancing its financial appeal.
              
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              We need this transformative approach to urban development.

By investing in green real estate, we’re building more than structures… we’re building a sustainable future.

             Reltime is an innovative blockchain platform that combines high-performance functionality with energy efficiency. It leverages advanced technology, such as Energy-Efficient Smart Contracts and a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, to offer secure, scalable, and sustainable decentralized solutions. Reltime’s focus on reducing energy consumption makes it a forward-thinking alternative in the blockchain space, driving both innovation and environmental responsibility.

                </div>
              <div>
              Reltime's Proof of Authority (PoA) Layer-1 blockchain is particularly well-suited for energy-efficient smart contracts due to its unique consensus mechanism. In PoA, instead of relying on resource-intensive mining or staking, trusted validators (often known entities with a reputation to uphold) are responsible for validating transactions and securing the network. This greatly reduces the computational resources needed for consensus compared to energy-heavy systems like Proof of Work (PoW).

              <div class="my-1"></div>
              Because PoA doesn't require the massive amounts of energy used in traditional mining processes, it allows Reltime’s smart contracts to operate more efficiently. The network’s energy consumption is lower, while maintaining security and speed, making it an ideal foundation for executing smart contracts that are both secure and environmentally friendly. In essence, PoA provides a streamlined, low-energy environment where smart contracts can run smoothly, without the heavy environmental cost seen in other blockchain models.

       Real estate NFTs are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or rights to a physical property or virtual real estate. In this space, properties meet blockchain and homes get tokenized. Imagine owning a slice of a luxury condo with the same ease as collecting digital art.

    introduction: `<div>
        The NFT business has been booming ever since it appeared in crypto, extending its branches towards famous paintings, custom digital art, personalities, and also real estate. The fact that users are trading digital property proves that real estate NFTs are more than just a hype… they’re a game changer.

        <div>
             Imagine if property deeds ditched their paper suits and got a techy makeover. That’s what NFTs bring to real estate. Let’s break this down piece by piece.

             <div class="my-3"></div>
             An NFT is a unique digital certificate stored on a blockchain, proving you own a specific asset. In real estate, this could mean a single NFT represents the ownership of a house, a commercial building, or even a slice of a massive real estate project. Think of it as your digital “I own this” badge that’s impossible to lose or forge.

             <div class="my-3"></div>
             Now, here’s where it gets fun: NFTs don’t just stop at owning the whole property. They also enable fractional ownership, so you can own a piece of that fancy downtown penthouse without selling a kidney. Developers mint NFTs tied to the property, and investors buy these tokens, gaining a stake in the asset and often a share of its rental income or future resale profits.

             <div class="my-3"></div>
             Thanks to blockchain’s transparency, every transaction involving the NFT is logged and auditable. No sketchy backdoor deals, no surprise fees. Plus, transferring ownership is as simple as sending the NFT from one crypto wallet to another. No more mountains of paperwork and weeks of waiting.

            We can differentiate traditional real estate ownership and tokenized real estate easily: just think of them as two people from different generations; one’s still counting paper money, and the other’s swiping a digital card to make a crypto payment.

Tokenized real estate is basically a Tesla; modern, fast, and automates almost all of its features. Both get you where you want to go, but one’s definitely got more style and less hassle. Whether you’re a fan of tradition or ready to embrace the crypto-cool, the choice is yours. But let’s face it… owning part of a penthouse with a tap on your phone? That’s hard to beat.

           Real estate NFTs represent a groundbreaking fusion of blockchain technology and property ownership, but this innovation exists in a legal and regulatory gray area. These are just some of the various challenges the real estate NFT business is facing.

            <div>
                <div class="text-lg md:text-2xl md:leading-normal leading-6 pb-1 font-medium">An Undefined Legal Framework
                </div>
              <div>
              The concept of tokenizing real estate doesn’t neatly align with existing property laws. Traditionally, ownership is defined by physical deeds and titles, regulated by local governments. Real estate NFTs, however, translate ownership or investment rights into digital tokens stored on blockchains. This paradigm shift raises the question: do current laws recognize NFTs as legitimate proof of ownership, and if so, under what conditions? 

              <div class="my-1"></div>
              The absence of specific legal frameworks creates uncertainty, leaving stakeholders vulnerable to disputes over their rights.

              <div class="my-1"></div>

              In any case, many lawyers are left scratching their heads and judges googling “What is Blockchain?” as we discuss this issue.

                </div>
              <div>
              Real estate is inherently local, and laws differ from one city, state, or country to the next. But NFTs live on global blockchains, where borders are just imaginary lines. So, what happens if someone in Tokyo buys an NFT representing a Miami condo? Whose laws apply? It's like trying to fit a square blockchain into a round legal hole.

              <div class="my-1"></div>
              There is always a way, but resolving such conflicts could be time-consuming and complex, especially in cross-border transactions.

                </div>
              <div>
              Many jurisdictions grapple with whether fractionalized real estate NFTs qualify as securities. When an NFT offers ownership of property shares, or income-generating rights like rent, you can bet regulators will see it as a security. This classification triggers compliance requirements, including registration, disclosure, investor protection rules and a bunch of awkward conversations with your legal team. 
              
              <div class="my-1"></div>
              Developers and platforms must navigate these laws carefully to avoid regulatory sanctions.

                </div>
              <div>
              Blockchain transactions offer unparalleled transparency, yet this clashes with traditional real estate norms, which often prioritize privacy. Publicly recording every ownership transfer on an immutable ledger could expose sensitive details, potentially breaching data protection laws. Balancing transparency with privacy is an ongoing regulatory dilemma.

                </div>
              <div>
              Traditional real estate has strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. But blockchain transactions are pseudonymous, making it harder to verify identities. Regulators want to know who’s behind that wallet address because no one wants their luxury NFT penthouse bought with laundered crypto.

                </div>
              <div>
              An NFT does not ‘always’ equate to direct property ownership. It may represent a share in a legal entity, a contractual right, or even a virtual representation. This nuance can lead to misunderstandings among buyers and complicate legal interpretations. Standardizing the relationship between the token and the underlying asset is necessary to avoid disputes.

NFTs are tied to the ever-swinging moods of blockchain markets, where values can soar like a penthouse view one day and plummet like a busted elevator the next.

Phishing scams, wallet hacks, and compromised marketplaces are just a few of the risks. And unlike losing your keys in the real world, recovering stolen NFTs is next to impossible, as there’s no blockchain police to call for backup.

Also, you'll find collectibles NFTs, made as unique items like trading cards or virtual figures with rarity and value.

              To create a real estate NFT, tokenize the property by linking its ownership or investment rights to a blockchain-based smart contract. Mint the NFT using a platform of your liking (it can be Ethereum, Solana, Polygon or whatever you prefer). Ensure legal compliance, define terms (e.g., fractional ownership), and securely store the asset's details and associated metadata.

              NFTs are used to represent unique digital or physical assets, providing proof of ownership and authenticity.

        Norway’s real estate market in 2025 is full of dynamic shifts and intriguing contrasts. There are lots of things going on, so let’s take a quick dive in the matter:

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        On one hand, housing prices are showing resilience, with an average rise of 5.9% in 2024, driven largely by urban demand in cities like Oslo, Stavanger, and Bergen. Stavanger, for example, is experiencing strong growth (up 7%), benefiting from renewed optimism in the oil and gas sector. In contrast, areas like Tromsø are seeing more moderate price increases as their higher housing supply tempers demand.
        <div class="my-1"></div>

        On the other hand, interest rates have also played a significant role, with Norges Bank raising its rate to 4.5% in 2023. Unfortunately, there weren’t any rate cuts in 2024 either.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        Meanwhile, the ongoing urbanization trend, paired with Norway’s population growth, keeps demand for modern, sustainable housing in urban hubs. 

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        Overall, the market is robust but nuanced, reflecting regional disparities and broader economic shifts. For now, savvy buyers and sellers are closely watching economic indicators as Norway's housing market continues to be influenced by both local and global factors.

        First, there’s the price tag problem. Norway’s real estate is notoriously expensive, especially in urban hotspots like Oslo. Though everyone wants to take part, not all of them can afford it.

        Next, the regulatory labyrinth. Norway prides itself on strong tenant protections and strict building codes. While this keeps quality high, navigating permits and zoning laws can feel like a necessary but very tiring effort.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        Then, there’s the supply-demand tango. Urban housing supply struggles to keep pace with demand, driving prices skyward. Meanwhile, in rural areas, properties struggle with finding takers, despite having a good value.
        <div class="my-1"></div>

        Finally, the green pressure cooker. Sustainability is non-negotiable in Norway, with stringent energy efficiency and environmental standards. It's great for the planet, but it adds cost and complexity for developers.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
         <div>
              <div class="text-lg md:text-2xl md:leading-normal leading-6 pb-1 font-medium">The Solution
                </div>
              <div>
              Fjord is a company that seeks to tokenize the real estate business in Norway, starting in the Oslofjord Marina. For this mission, they have launched their own blockchain-powered Oslofjord Marina Token and are dedicating their efforts towards a way for everyone to enter this business.

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        Now, here’s where every problem finds its solution. We already mentioned prices are too expensive… but who says you need to buy the whole thing? Tokenization lowers the entry bar, enabling individuals to invest small amounts in high-value assets.

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        Fjord’s tokenization approach could unlock liquidity in the market and give it a HUGE boost by allowing fractional ownership. Investors can own a slice of that Oslo charm without needing to buy an entire property, effectively broadening the market and easing demand pressure.  

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        What about regulations? With blockchain-powered smart contracts, Fjord can streamline compliance, automating paperwork and ensuring every transaction aligns with local laws. Thus, the law is satisfied, and so are investors.

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        Blockchain can also help Fjord track every material used, from eco-friendly insulation to sustainably sourced wood, ensuring buildings are as green as Norway’s fjords. Think of it as a public ledger for Mother Nature’s approval and the investors’ too.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        Developers can also monitor energy usage, optimize systems, and prove compliance with Norway’s strict green standards. Not bad at all, huh?

        Norway's real estate industry has been on a heavy transition towards high-tech mechanisms, integrating cutting-edge technology to make processes more efficient and sustainable.

                </div>
              <div>
              Once upon a time, real estate was all about paperwork and in-person interactions. Fast-forward to today, and the sector is practically a sci-fi movie! Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are transforming how Norwegians explore properties, letting buyers tour homes from the comfort of their couches—no winter coats required. These immersive tools are now staples for showcasing designs or renovations, saving time and money while enhancing decision-making.

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        The Internet of Things (IoT) has made buildings smarter than ever. Think energy-efficient thermostats that adjust automatically or sensors that detect water leaks before you even notice… pretty cool, right?

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics are empowering real estate professionals with insights on pricing, buyer preferences, and even predictive maintenance schedules.

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        Oh, and don’t forget about blockchain! Norway is embracing secure, streamlined property transactions with this technology, automating processes like payments and ownership verification while reducing the risk of fraud. This is part of the broader PropTech revolution, where property management software, digital workflows, and smart solutions keep tenants happy and costs low.

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        While innovation is thriving, it’s not just about bells and whistles, it’s also about sustainability. Norwegian developers are using tech to reduce environmental impacts, optimizing energy use in buildings and integrating renewable energy sources into their designs​.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        All of these breakthroughs have made the real estate business evolve in a way that benefits everyone involved, setting an example for other countries.

              Let’s say that after finding a good relationship in price and scenery and going all out on occasional fierce bidding wars, you find your dream home, you’ll need a hefty deposit, a lot of patience, and a broker to guide you through the labyrinth of prices that can vary like the weather.

              To get started and buy property, you’ll need a 15% down payment, with the rest financed by a mortgage. You also need a bank’s approval, which can be easier if you're a permanent resident.

    introduction: `<div>
        Tokenization is a word that is fast becoming a staple of everyday conversation. It is changing how we interact with physical assets by representing them on the blockchain as <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/59 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://cryptopotato.com/best-rwa-cryptos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real-World Assets (RWAs)</a>.
        
        <div class="my-4"></div>
        Since their emergence, these tokens, which make asset management more efficient through <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/90 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://www.rwa.io/post/the-role-of-smart-contracts-in-tokenized-real-world-assets#ethereum-and-the-advent-of-smart-contracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encoded logic</a> and automation, have seen their value grow exponentially.  In 2018, they had a global market capitalization standing at a modest $1.5 billion; fast-forward to 2025, and it has multiplied ten times to <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/59 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/categories/real-world-assets-rwa/?sh=20e4c6a71126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$15 billion</a>, with projections suggesting it could go as high as $16 trillion by 2030.
        

        <div class="my-4"></div>
        However, despite its transformative potential, tokenization still presents a huge challenge: navigating the constantly changing regulatory landscape. The legal classification of RWAs varies across jurisdictions, with some countries treating them as securities and, therefore, applying existing laws, while others are crafting bespoke legislation to govern them. 
        
        <div class="my-4"></div>
        For instance, Norway is a member of the <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/59 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/en/content/european-economic-area-eea-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Economic Area</a> (EEA) and adopts most of its regulatory framework for digital assets from European Union (EU) laws. However, despite not having specific domestic rules for RWAs, Norway’s general legal principles, spanning contract law, tax regulations, and consumer protection, can still apply, depending on the context. 

        </div>`,
    content: [
      {
        heading: "Classification of Tokenized Assets",
        para: `<div> 

        The classification given to tokenized assets in a particular jurisdiction has significant implications. The main consideration is typically whether or not the tokenized asset is to be considered a security, in which case it must comply with the particular nation’s securities laws, including registration, reporting, and disclosure requirements.

        <div class="my-1"></div>

        In the United States, for instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses the “Howey Test” to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an ‘investment contract.’ If a tokenized asset passes the Howey Test, it is considered a security and must comply with <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/90 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://www.fenwick.com/insights/publications/tokenized-real-world-assets-pathways-to-sec-registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEC regulations</a>.
        <div class="my-1"></div>

        The European Union (EU), on the other hand, has adopted a harmonised approach through several regulations, including the <span class="font-medium">Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)</span> in 2004, <span class="font-medium">MiFID II</span> in 2018, and <span class="font-medium"> Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulation (MiCA)</span> in 2023.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        It is important to note that tokenizing RWAs does not change the intrinsic nature of the assets themselves, and the essence of the RWA invariably governs considerations such as the application of securities laws or consumer protection measures.

          <div class="my-1"></div>

          A key feature of MiFID is the classification of clients or investors into particular categories: professional investors, retail investors, and eligible counterparties. The rationale for this categorisation is that the regulatory protection for the investors ought to reflect the different levels of risk faced by each specific client type. Since different types of investors have different levels of financial knowledge, it follows that they should be provided with different levels of protection when dealing with a financial body. 

          <div class="my-1"></div>
          Retail clients are offered the highest level of protection, while eligible counterparts are provided the least. Also, information such as the specific risks, transactional details, and overall explanations are provided depending on the type of investor.

          <div class="text-lg md:text-2xl md:leading-normal leading-6 pb-1 font-medium">Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II)</div>

          In order to restore confidence in the markets following the 2008 financial crisis, the EU enacted <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/90 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014L0065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MiFID II</a> in 2018. MiFID II extended its scope to issuers of all types of securities and enhanced the transparency and reporting requirements for securities trades. It also extended investor protection for all kinds of securities trades, regardless of whether the investor is located within or outside of the EU. 
          <div class="my-1"></div>

          Crucially, MiFID II was <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/90 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32022R0858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amended in 2022</a> to include distributed ledger-based instruments such as tokenized securities and crypto-assets.

Under MiCA, the EU is guided by the principles of: “<a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/90 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/european-crypto-assets-regulation-mica.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same activities, same risks, same rules</a>”, and technology neutrality. 
          <div class="my-1"></div>

          MiCA seeks to create a <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/90 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated harmonised framework</a> to support innovation while providing for the proportionate treatment of issuers of crypto assets and crypto service providers to scale up their businesses. MiCA also seeks to provide benefits such as cheaper, quicker, and more secure financial services and asset management.
          <div class="my-1"></div>

          Notably, MiCA does not apply to crypto-assets representing services or physical assets that are unique and non-fungible, such as product guarantees or real estate. The <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/90 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32022R0858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rationale for exemption</a> of unique and non-fungible assets from the scope of MiCA regulation is that while they may be traded on the marketplace and accumulated speculatively, they are not readily interchangeable, and the relative value of one such crypto asset in relation to another, each being unique, cannot be ascertained by means of comparison to an existing market or equivalent asset—such features therefore limit the risks to holders and the financial system, thereby justifying their exclusion from the scope of MiCA.

        Norway is yet to enact any specific legislation towards the regulation of distributed ledger technology, particularly regarding RWAs, and the EU laws therefore apply. Since RWAs come in a variety of forms, such as commodities, titles, or economic rights attached to real estate, IP, etc., such tokens may qualify into one of the three categories of crypto assets under MiCA: electronic money tokens (EMT), asset-referenced tokens (ART), and utility tokens.

        (ARTs), which are assets that purport to maintain a stable value by referring to the value of one or several commodities, particular have a special place in MiCA. As the new MiCA regulations enter into force in December 2024, certain mandatory rules shall apply to ARTs, including: publishing a whitepaper, obtaining approvals from relevant authorities regarding whitepaper and marketing material, providing a legal opinion on the legal nature of the token, providing issuing company’s the governance structure, ensuring the issuing company’s management is fit and proper, and ensuring a minimum level of capital at EUR 350,000.

        The collaboration between Fjord and <a class="underline bg-white/30 px-2 rounded py-0.5 hover:bg-white/59 hover:text-blue-700 ease-in-out transition-colors duration-300" href="https://www.reltime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reltime</a> will tokenize four major construction projects in Norway, starting with the Oslofjord Marina Project. Through Reltime’s RWA tokenization platform, investors will be able to buy digital tokens representing shares in these properties across Norway, thereby removing traditional barriers to property ownership.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        The Oslofjord Marina Project enables investors to gain early access since they can participate right from the construction phase all through to project completion. Once the project construction is completed, investors can continue buying, selling, or holding onto their fractional property shares, allowing them to create a flexible investment model aligning with their particular goals.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        The Fjord Oslofjord Marina Project represents a new era for the global real estate market, with enormous benefits such as: global access for international investors into Norwegian real estate, daily rental income for token holders, liquidity and appreciation as tokens are tradeable in global markets, community driven governance by token holders, and professional management of properties for a smooth investment experience.

        <div class="my-1"></div>
        At the moment, Fjord Oslofjord Marina Project will be bound by EU legislation, but due to the dynamic nature of the blockchain sector, it shouldn’t be too surprising if very soon Norway comes up with its own legislation to buttress the existing EU regulations.
